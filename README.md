Electron based app for reading the Bible.com website

# About
I wanted a way to read the Bible from Bible.com without always going to the browser. I really like the site that Bible.com has and all the features and tools they provide to their users. 

My goal is to help bring this to the desktop for more people to use. 

# Wiki
More details on how to run and build the app can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cjerrington/Bible-for-Desktop/wiki).
